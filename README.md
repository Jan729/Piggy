A 2 player dice game. Players take turns 'rolling the dice' to earn points. Keep rolling as many times per turn, but if you roll an unlucky number you'll earn 0 points for that round! First one to 100 points wins!

This was one of my first coding projects from grade 12, when I just started learning Java in an AP Computer Science A course. The project itself was created during the spring of 2018.
