A 2 player dice game with elements of risk and luck. Players take turns 'rolling the dice' to earn points. Keep rolling as many times per turn, but if you roll an unlucky number you'll earn 0 points for that round! First one to 100 points wins!

This was one of my first coding projects from grade 12, when I just started learning Java in an AP Computer Science A course. The project itself was created during the spring of 2018.
